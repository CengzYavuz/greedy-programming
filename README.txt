This project is a solution for the Algorithm Analysis assigment , focusing on implementing a greedy algorithm to assign problems to judges in a programming competition. The goal is to minimize the total switching cost between different problem types, adhering to constraints that the problem order cannot be altered and judges can only evaluate one problem at a time. The solution is developed in Java, taking inputs for the number of judges, the cost of switching problem types, and the sequence of problem types from a file. The output is the minimum total cost of switching, ensuring the algorithm operates in polynomial time. The project includes detailed analysis and comments on the running time of each method implemented.
